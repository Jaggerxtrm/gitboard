# xtrm Observability Datasource Contract

Status: design contract for `forge-ow7c.3`, pre-implementation.

Console consumes telemetry; it does not own telemetry production. This contract
defines the boundary between Console panels/evidence surfaces and upstream
systems such as Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, specialists forensic state, future
OpenTelemetry traces, AWS/CloudWatch evidence, and substrate-native records.

## Ownership

- `mercury/infra` owns Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Alertmanager, exporters,
  scrape targets, alert rules, Terraform/IaC, and future infra query MCP.
- `specialists` owns AgentOps runtime events, `xtrm.forensic.v1`, Prometheus
  projections, MCP/tool semantics, token usage, evals, and policy/identity
  evidence.
- Console owns datasource descriptors, query proxy/client contracts, dashboard
  JSON, panel rendering, drilldowns, and operator approval UX.

If a signal is missing, Console records a missing-signal evidence item and routes
work to the owning repo. It must not patch local fake metrics into existence.

## Signals

The datasource layer is multi-signal from day one.

```ts
export type ObserveSignalKind =
  | "metric"
  | "log"
  | "trace"
  | "eval"
  | "alert"
  | "dashboard"
  | "journal"
  | "recommendation"
  | "runbook"
  | "forensic_event";
```

Phase 0 may render only metrics and evidence metadata, but the contract must
already carry all signal kinds so dashboards and agent-authored panels do not
become Prometheus-only.

## Datasource Descriptor

```ts
export interface ObserveTenantContext {
  tenantId: string;
  deploymentEnvironment: "local" | "staging" | "production" | string;
  repo?: string;
  serviceNamespace?: string;
  serviceName?: string;
}

export interface ObserveDatasourceDescriptor {
  id: string;
  kind:
    | "prometheus"
    | "grafana"
    | "loki"
    | "otel_trace"
    | "specialists_forensic"
    | "aws_agentcore"
    | "substrate"
    | "static_fixture";
  title: string;
  tenant: ObserveTenantContext;
  authMode: "server_proxy" | "internal_socket" | "none";
  capabilities: ObserveSignalKind[];
  writePolicy: "read_only" | "draft_requires_approval";
  freshness: ObserveFreshness;
  links?: ObserveLink[];
}
```

Rules:

- `authMode="server_proxy"` is the default for networked backends. Browser code
  never receives raw Prometheus/Grafana/AWS credentials.
- `writePolicy="read_only"` is required for query backends. Agent-authored
  dashboard specs are drafts until the operator accepts them.
- `substrate` means future live substrate daemon/API reads. Do not copy
  substrate-native state into a second SQLite projection.
- `static_fixture` exists for tests, previews, and design fixtures.

## Query Request

```ts
export interface ObserveQueryRequest {
  datasourceId: string;
  signalKind: ObserveSignalKind;
  query: ObserveQuery;
  range: ObserveTimeRange;
  tenant: ObserveTenantContext;
  limits: ObserveQueryLimits;
  evidenceContext?: ObserveEvidenceContext;
}

export type ObserveQuery =
  | { kind: "promql"; expr: string }
  | { kind: "logql"; expr: string }
  | { kind: "grafana_panel"; dashboardUid: string; panelId: string; vars?: Record<string, string | string[]> }
  | { kind: "trace_lookup"; traceId: string; spanId?: string }
  | { kind: "forensic_events"; jobId?: string; beadId?: string; cursor?: string }
  | { kind: "eval_lookup"; evalId?: string; jobId?: string }
  | { kind: "recommendation_lookup"; recommendationId?: string; taskId?: string }
  | { kind: "journal_lookup"; taskId?: string; cursor?: string }
  | { kind: "runbook_lookup"; ref: string };

export interface ObserveTimeRange {
  fromUnixMs: number;
  toUnixMs: number;
  stepMs?: number;
}

export interface ObserveQueryLimits {
  maxSeries?: number;
  maxRows?: number;
  maxBytes?: number;
  timeoutMs?: number;
}
```

Rules:

- Every request has an explicit time range except direct id lookups.
- Query limits are mandatory at the server boundary.
- Raw shell commands, raw URLs as query language, and arbitrary file paths are
  not datasource queries.
- PromQL/LogQL strings pass through to owning backends; Console does not parse
  or reinterpret their language beyond validation/syntax highlighting.

## Query Response

```ts
export interface ObserveQueryResponse {
  datasourceId: string;
  signalKind: ObserveSignalKind;
  status: "ok" | "partial" | "missing_signal" | "error";
  range: ObserveTimeRange;
  freshness: ObserveFreshness;
  data: ObserveResultData;
  evidence: ObserveEvidenceRef[];
  diagnostics?: ObserveDiagnostics;
}

export type ObserveResultData =
  | { kind: "metric_matrix"; series: ObserveMetricSeries[] }
  | { kind: "metric_vector"; samples: ObserveMetricSample[] }
  | { kind: "logs"; rows: ObserveLogRow[] }
  | { kind: "trace"; trace: ObserveTraceSummary }
  | { kind: "eval"; evals: ObserveEvalSummary[] }
  | { kind: "alerts"; alerts: ObserveAlertSummary[] }
  | { kind: "dashboard_ref"; dashboard: ObserveDashboardRef }
  | { kind: "journal"; records: ObserveJournalRecord[] }
  | { kind: "recommendations"; records: ObserveRecommendationRecord[] }
  | { kind: "forensic_events"; events: unknown[] };
```

`partial` is valid when one backend returns enough evidence to render a useful
panel but some linked drilldown is unavailable. `missing_signal` means Console
knows which owning repo must add a signal.

## Evidence References

Evidence refs are the drilldown bridge from aggregate panel to precise detail.

```ts
export interface ObserveEvidenceRef {
  id: string;
  kind:
    | "prometheus_query"
    | "grafana_dashboard"
    | "grafana_panel"
    | "loki_query"
    | "trace_span"
    | "specialist_forensic_event"
    | "specialist_job"
    | "eval_result"
    | "alert"
    | "journal_record"
    | "recommendation"
    | "runbook"
    | "bead"
    | "github";
  source: string;
  title: string;
  timeRange?: ObserveTimeRange;
  queryText?: string;
  correlation?: Record<string, string>;
  redaction?: { status: "clean" | "redacted" | "unknown"; fields?: string[] };
  links?: ObserveLink[];
}
```

High-cardinality identifiers such as `job_id`, `bead_id`, `trace_id`,
`span_id`, `tool_call_id`, `mcp_session_id`, `jsonrpc_request_id`,
`recommendationId`, and `journalRecordId` belong in `correlation` and evidence
refs. They must not become Prometheus labels.

## Label Discipline

Console must treat the specialists Prometheus projection contract as
authoritative for labels.

Allowed labels include bounded identity and state fields such as:

- `service_namespace`
- `service_name`
- `service_component`
- `deployment_environment`
- `repo`
- `participant_kind`
- `participant_role`
- `state`
- `result`
- `model_provider`
- allowlisted `model`
- normalized `tool_name`
- `mcp_server`
- `mcp_method`
- normalized `error_type`
- `direction`
- `policy_kind`
- `eval_kind`
- `chain_template`
- `gate_kind`

Forbidden labels include:

- `job_id`
- `bead_id`
- `issue_id`
- `participant_id`
- `chain_id`
- `container_id`
- `trace_id`
- `span_id`
- `session_id`
- `conversation_id`
- `tool_call_id`
- `mcp_session_id`
- `jsonrpc_request_id`
- `eval_id`
- `policy_decision_id`
- raw path, command, URL, error text, prompt, diff, user/email/token, or secret
  material.

## Freshness And Cache

```ts
export interface ObserveFreshness {
  observedAtUnixMs?: number;
  sourceUpdatedAtUnixMs?: number;
  cachedAtUnixMs?: number;
  cacheStatus: "live" | "last_successful" | "stale" | "fixture" | "unknown";
  maxAgeMs?: number;
}
```

Rules:

- Panels must show when they are using `last_successful` or `stale` data.
- Substrate-native reads may use a small last-successful cache to survive daemon
  restarts. That cache is not a materializer.
- Fixture responses must remain visibly marked as `fixture`.

## Safety And Auth

- Networked datasource requests go through a server-side proxy.
- Grafana/MCP posture is read-only by default, equivalent to disable-write plus
  tool/category allowlists.
- Agent-authored dashboard/panel specs are drafts until accepted by an operator.
- Writes to Grafana dashboards, alert rules, incidents, or annotations are out
  of scope for Console Phase 0/1.
- Request/response payload visibility is opt-in, redacted, and trace-linked.
- Missing upstream data becomes follow-up work in the owning repo, not a local
  workaround.

## Fixture Requirements

The first fixture pack should include:

- Prometheus metric matrix and vector rows.
- Grafana dashboard/panel/deeplink evidence refs.
- Loki/log evidence rows with labels.
- OTel trace/span summary with linked MCP tool call.
- Specialists `xtrm.forensic.v1` event envelope.
- Eval result summary.
- AWS-style task/recommendation/journal records.
- Missing-signal example routed to `mercury/infra`.
- Forbidden-label rejection fixture.

## Follow-Up Beads

Created under `forge-ow7c` and blocked on this contract where appropriate:

- `forge-ow7c.8`: implement Console datasource contract and static fixture
  datasource.
- `forge-ow7c.9`: add contract fixtures and safety guards for every
  `ObserveSignalKind`, range, result limits, auth mode, forbidden labels, and
  missing-signal routing.
- `forge-ow7c.10`: define dashboard schema validator, migration fixture, and
  agent-authored approval-state tests.
- `forge-ow7c.11`: implement first Phase 0 panels against static fixtures, not
  live Prometheus.
